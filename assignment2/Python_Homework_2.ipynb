Within the scope of this homework, we use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph. Normally, a vertex name is not necessarily a number. This naming convention will simplify our implementation given that we have not covered symbol table concept. We use the notation **v-w** to refer to an edge that connects v and w. For example: 0-1 is an edge connecting 0 and 1, and 1-0 refers to the same edge in undirected graph. \n",

    "2.   Visit all the vertices that are adjacent to it and that have not yet been marked. \n",

    "The important keyword is **marked**, thus we should have an attribute in our API to keep track of visited vertices. A very interesting note about DFS is we can implement it in a recursive fashion or by using stack. We will provide you with the API that implement recursive DFS, which serves as a good template for you to implement DFS the other way. \n",

    "1.   **Connectivity:** Are the two given vertices connected? How many vertices are connected to a source vertex s\n",

    "It can be seen that we need 2 variables to track the connectivity and the path. we will call them *marked* and *edgeTo*. *marked* tracks if search algorithm has visited the vertex or not. It is just a simple array of boolean values which are initially set to false. *edgeTo* tracks the last vertex of known path to a particular vertex. It is also an array but of integer values. An animation of how Recursive DFS works is provided in Fig 3 below. The source vertex does not have to be 0. We could start at any vertex but we choose 0 as an example.
